• Problem Statement: Accurately forecast air quality components such as humidity and temperature to support 
environmental monitoring.  
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using NumPy, pandas, seaborn and performed time series analysis on historical 
air quality data.  
• Implemented FB Prophet algorithm in Python to develop a predictive model for air component variations.
